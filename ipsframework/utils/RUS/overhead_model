Overheads to model in RUS
=========================

Resource Description
--------------------
 * READ_RATE and WRITE_RATE
   + MB/s for reading/writing a file on shared file system
   + used to calculate I/O bound activities

Framework
---------
 * STARTUP
   + constant, not dependent on I/O or other system things??
   + captures IPS activities such as:
     - config file parsing
     - component creation
     - portal connection
     - resource detection
 * SHUTDOWN
   + constant, not dependent on I/O or other system things??
   + captures IPS activities such as:
     - final messages to portal
     - portal disconnect
     - component destruction
     - final data movement activities???

Simulation
----------
 * STARTUP
   + mostly I/O, but perhaps some constant time stuff too
   + captures IPS activities such as:
     - init of driver component
     - first part of driver component's execution where it sets up things and calls init on all the other components
 * RESTART
   + probably the same as STARTUP, but may be different
   + captures IPS activities such as:
     - init of driver component in restart mode
     - first part of driver component's execution where it sets up things and calls restart on all the other components
 * SHUTDOWN (?)
 * CHECKPOINT
   + I/O dominant
     - dependent on read and write speeds (defined in resource config file) and amount of data to move
   + captures IPS activities such as:
     - creation of a directory for new checkpoint
     - reading of all the output files from each component
     - writing of those files to checkpoint location
     - removal of old checkpoints
   + only occurs at certain times (fixed or at intervals)
     - mode: walltime_regular, walltime_explicit, phystime_regular, phystime_explicit
     - {wall | phys}time_values  -or-  {wall | phys}time_interval
     - num_checkpoint (how many to keep around)

Component
---------
 * STARTUP
   + I/O dominant
     - data size should be constant throughout a phase, thus the time should remain constant throughout the phase
   + captures IPS activities such as:
     - copy input files from inputdir to workdir
     - copy plasma state files from master to workdir
     - copy input files to ouputdir
 * SAVESTATE
   + I/O dominant
     - data size should be constant throughout a phase, thus the time should remain constant throughout the phase
   + captures IPS activities such as:
     - copy output files from workdir to outputdir
     - copy plasma state files from workdir to master
 * REWORK
   + time spent redoing work after a failure
     - includes data staging activities
   + calculated by the system, not modeled
 * WAITING
   + time spent waiting for resources
   + calculated by the system, not modeled

Other overheads:
--------------------------
 * monitor component activities
   - this is a no resource, I/O dominant component
 * framework and framework component overheads
   - no data or inclination that this would impact overall performance in any meaningful way
 * contention from other sims
   - no data or inclination that this would impact overall performance in any meaningful way
