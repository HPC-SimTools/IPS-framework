#   I enclosed all variables that were used in tests involving STREQUAL
#   in ${} and enclosed all literal strings that were used in tests
#   involving STREQUAL in double quotes so that it would create the
#   correct architecture string on AIX.
#
#   I modified the architecture string it generates on AIX to be either
#   ibm-aix-pwr or ibm-aix-pwr64.

#   I made Mac 10.x and later use darwin-x86_64.
