# Examples

This directory is meant to showcase concrete code examples on how to use the IPS framework.

Each example folder contains specific instructions on how to run it. Each example is standalone and can be copy/pasted into its own file.

Note that each example will explicitly need to be installed into its own virtual environment - this is because the IPS framework needs all of your Components to be contained in a valid Python package.
