========
For Dakota run:
  Dakota input file.  Read by Dakota to drive the entire run.
  IPS config file: Master config file.  Driver is concurrent.  
  Dakota gives the new values, and the Dakota bridge changes the config file:
   SIM_ROOT specifies where to put them all

Way that Dakota runs
ips_dakota_dynamic.py from the command line
Just type it to see the command line arguments.

DRIVER=Dakota_bridge

Look at Wael's driver.     Look at Dakota_bridge.  
 IPS_DAKOTA.config is hard-coded as environment variable specifying the master file.

Look in:
/Users/kruger/swimroot/ips/components/drivers/elwasif
Create a test case based on this.

ips_dakota_dynamic.py --dakotaconfig=dakota_test_Resonbrock.in --config=dakota_test_Rosenbrock.config
