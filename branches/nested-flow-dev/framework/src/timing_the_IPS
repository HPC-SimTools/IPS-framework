In order to get timing data for the IPS, you need to first install 
Tau (http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/tau/home.php).  

When installing it be sure to specify the location of pythoninc and 
pythonlib.  Installation instructions can be found here:
http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/tau/docs/newguide/bk02ch01.html

OR

On jaguar you can make the following changes to your path and python 
path to use the installation of TAU I installed:

PATH:           /lustre/scr144/ssfoley/tau-2.18.2p2/x86_64/bin
PYTHONPATH:     /lustre/scr144/ssfoley/tau-2.18.2p2/x86_64/lib


Once tau is set up and is working properly, set the environment 
variable IPS_TIMING to 1.  There are a set of functions defined in 
ipsTiming that create, start, stop, and dump tau timer data.

Currently instrumented:
    ips.py
    services.py

Results:
After a run, you will find dump file called "dump.0.0.0" in the current
working directory, as well as in the work directories of all the 
components that have executed.  You can rename the file profile.0.0.0 
and run pprof at the command line to look at the data, or you can just 
look at the raw file.
