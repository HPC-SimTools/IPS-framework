First let's distinguish the types of inputs:

Default values:
    These are "safe" values that are generally the same as what's
    tested.  We'll get those from the GUI tags.
Cloned values:
    These are values coming from a previous run.
Editted values:
    These comes from editing the template itself.  This is similar to
    the current power user using txpp.py
GUI values:
    These come from the GUI/python CLI
Other values:
    Any other place that specifies the values (e.g., a SWIM config file)


The goal of the workflow is to show how each type of input is used.
First, look at the workflow.sh script to show the different types of
inputs, and how they would be used.
