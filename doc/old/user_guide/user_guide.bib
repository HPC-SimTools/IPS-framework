  abstract={The FACETS (Framework Application for Core-Edge Transport
                  Simulations) project began in January 2007 with the
                  goal of providing core to wall transport modeling of
                  a tokamak fusion reactor. This involves coupling
                  previously separate computations for the core, edge,
                  and wall regions. Such a coupling is primarily
                  through connection regions of lower
                  dimensionality. The project has started developing a
                  component-based coupling framework to bring together
                  models for each of these regions. In the first year,
                  the core model will be a 1 \frac12{} dimensional
                  model (1D transport across flux surfaces coupled to
                  a 2D equilibrium) with fixed equilibrium. The
                  initial edge model will be the fluid model, UEDGE,
                  but inclusion of kinetic models is planned for the
                  out years. The project also has an embedded
                  Scientific Application Partnership that is examining
                  embedding a full-scale turbulence model for
                  obtaining the crosssurface fluxes into a core
                  transport code.}
