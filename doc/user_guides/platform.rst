====================================
Platforms and Platform Configuration
====================================

This section will describe key aspects of the platforms that the IPS has been ported to, key locations relevant to the IPS, and the platform configuration settings in general and specific to the platforms described below.

**Important Note** - while this documentation is intended to remain up to date, it may not always reflect the current status of the machines.  If you run into problems, check that the information below is accurate by looking at the websites for the machine.  If you are still having problems, contact the framework developers.

----------------
Ported Platforms
----------------

Each subsection will contain information about the platform in question.  If you are porting the IPS to a new platform, these are the items that you will need to know or files and directories to create in order to port the IPS.  You will also need a platform configuration file (:ref:`described below<plat-conf-sec>`).  Available queue names are listed with the most common ones in **bold**.

The platforms below fall into the following categories: 

  * general production machines - large production machines on which the majority of runs (particularly production runs) are made.  
  * experimental systems - production or shared machines that are being used by a subset of SWIM members for specific research projects.  These systems may also be difficult for others to get accounts.
  * formerly used systems - machines that the IPS was ported to but we either do not have time on that machine, it has been retired by its hosting site, or it is not in wide use anymore.
  * single user systems - laptop or desktop machines for testing small problems.

Platform Configuration File
---------------------------
The platform configuration file contains platform specific information that the framework needs.  Typically it does not need to be changed for one user to another or one run to another (except for manual specification of allocation resources).  For *most* of the platforms above, you will find platform configuration files of the form ``ips/<machine name>.conf``.  It is not likely that you will need to change this file, but it is described here for users working on experimental machines, manual specification of resources, and users who need to port the IPS to a new machine.

**HOST**
        name of the platform.  Used by the portal.
**MPIRUN**
        command to launch parallel applications.  Used by the task
	manager to launch parallel tasks on compute nodes.  If you
	would like to launch a task directly without the parallel
	launcher (say, on a SMP style machine or workstation), set
	this to "eval" -- it tells the task manager to directly launch 	the task as ``<binary> <args>``.
**\*_ROOT**
        locations of data and binaries.  Used by the configuration
	file and components to run the tasks of the simulation.
**\*_URL**
        portal URLs.  Used to connect to and communicate with the
	portal.
**NODE_DETECTION**
        method to use to detect the number of nodes and processes in
	the allocation.  If the value is "manual," then the manual
	allocation description is used.  If nothing is specified, all
	of the methods are attempted and the first one to succeed will
	be used.  Note, if the allocation detection fails, the
	framework will abort, killing the job.  See :doc:`Porting the
	IPS<../developer_guides/porting>` for more 
	information [#node_detection]_.
**TOTAL_PROCS**
        number of processes in the allocation [#manual_alloc_node]_.
**NODES**
        number of nodes in the allocation [#manual_alloc_node]_.
**PROCS_PER_NODE**
        number of processes per node (ppn) for the framework 
	[#manual_alloc_ppn]_.
**CORES_PER_NODE**
        number of cores per node [#nochange]_.
**SOCKETS_PER_NODE**
        number of sockets per node [#nochange]_.
**NODE_ALLOCATION_MODE**
        'EXCLUSIVE' for one task per node, and 'SHARED' if more than
	one task can share a node [#nochange]_.  Simulations,
	components and tasks can set their node usage allocation
	policies in the configuration file and on task launch.


.. [#nochange] This value should not change unless the machine is
   upgraded to a different architecture or implements different
   allocation policies.

.. [#manual_alloc_ppn]  Used in manual allocation detection and will
   override any detected ppn value (if smaller than the machine
   maximum ppn).

.. [#manual_alloc_node] Only used if manual allocation is specified,
   or if no detection mechanism is specified and none of the other
   mechansims work first.  It is the *users* responsibility for this
   value to make sense.

.. [#node_detection] Currently the porting documentation is under
   construction.  Use python script
   ``ips/framework/utils/test_resource_parsing.py`` to determine 
   which automatic parsing works for the platform in question.  If
   nothing works, use the manual settings and contact the framework
   developers to look into developing a method for automatically
   detecting the allocation.


.. note : the node allocation and detection values in this file can be overriden by command line options to the ips ``--nodes`` and ``--ppn``.  *Both* values must be specified, otherwise the platform configuration values are used.

Due to the recent changes in the framework regarding resource management, some platforms may not have platform configuration files in the repository.  Below is a list of those that are in the repo and work with the recent changes to the framework.

* franklin
* hopper
* odin
* sif
* stix [#manual_only]_
* swim [#manual_only]_

In addition to these files, there is ``ips/workstation.conf``, a sample platform configuration file for a workstation.  It assumes that the workstation:

  * does not have a batch scheduler or resource manager
  * may have multiple cores and sockets
  * does not have portal access
  * will manually specify the allocation

  # For single node jobs, this can be overridden allowing multiple
  # tasks per node.
  NODE_ALLOCATION_MODE = SHARED # SHARED | EXCLUSIVE


.. [#manual_only] These need to be updated to match the "allocation"
   size each time.  Alternatively, you can just use the 
   :doc:`command line<basic_guide>` to specify the number of nodes 
   and processes per node.
