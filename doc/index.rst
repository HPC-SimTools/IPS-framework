Welcome to Integrated Plasma Simulator (IPS)'s documentation!
=============================================================

IPS (Integrated Plasma Simulator) is an environment to orchestrate
complex coupled simulation workflows on parallel computers. The IPS is
designed primarily for use in a batch-processing environment, with a
batch job typically comprising a single invocation of the framework,
calling the individual physics codes many times as the simulation
progresses.
