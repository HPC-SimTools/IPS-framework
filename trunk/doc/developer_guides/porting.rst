Guide to Porting the IPS
========================

**Coming Soon**

This document will describe the procedure for porting the IPS to a new platform.  It is designed for developers since this process unfortunately requires changes to the resource management piece of code in the framework.  We hope to make this unnecessary in the future.

There is a work around for porting.  You can use the manual resource specification interface in the platform configuration file.  See :doc:`../user_guides/platform` for details.
