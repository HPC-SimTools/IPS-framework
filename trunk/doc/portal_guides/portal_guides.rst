=============
Portal Guides
=============

The `web portal <http://swim.gat.com:8080/display/>`_ shows the progress and 
status of IPS runs on a variety of machines.  The simulation configuration 
file and platform configuration file contain entries that allow the IPS to 
publish events to the portal.  See the documentation on each in the various 
guides listed :doc:`here <../user_guides/user_guides>`.

On the top-level page, you will see information about each run including who 
ran it, the current status, physics time stamp, wall time, and a descriptive 
comment.  From there you can click on a Run ID to see the details of that run, 
including calls on components, data movement events, task launches and 
finishes, and checkpoints. 


On the portal, there is a section where you can logon to perform advanced 
actions such as searching and editing runs.  You will need to use your OpenID 
for accessing this functionality (see :ref:`acctmgmt`).

Account Management for SWIM Project and Portal
----------------------------------------------

(This was taken from `cswim.org <cswim.org>`_.)

The SWIM project is hosted on the ORNL SciCompForge service. Accounts on this service are managed through XCAMS. Many other externally-facing ORNL collaborative services, such as the CPES project also use XCAMS accounts.

To create an XCAMS account (or update an existing account) with access to the SciCompForge and OpenID services:

**Note to ORNL staff: UCAMS three-character IDs cannot be used for OpenID. You should create a separate XCAMS identity for use in the SWIM project.**

* Request access to the SWIM project on SciCompForge at `https://forge-ldap.ornl.gov/forge-project-requests.html <https://forge-ldap.ornl.gov/forge-project-requests.html>`_
* List *cswim* for the project name
* List *David Bernholdt* for the project owner

  **Note: if you already have an XCAMS account and SciCompForge access (perhaps as a CPES project member), you need to complete this form to be added to the SWIM project**

* Email David Bernholdt (bernholdtde@ornl.gov) to notify him of your request. Once your request is processed, you'll receive a reply in confirmation.

**Forgot your password?**

Go to the XCAMS web page and follow the "I Forgot my Password" link. If you don't succeed in resetting your password through the web site, you'll need to contact the ORNL Help Line for assistance at 865-241-ORNL. *Note: password reminder links on the cswim.org web site do not work, and no one in the SWIM project can reset XCAMS passwords.*
