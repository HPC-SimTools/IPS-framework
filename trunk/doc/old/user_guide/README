This User' s Guide is designed to explain the IPS (its structure and how to 
use it) as well as a reference for general IPS users.  It is organized as 
follows:

overview.txt: provides an overview of the structure of the IPS and what it 
can be used for.

components.txt: general and specific information on how to create 
components.  Also includes information on how to create drivers and a list 
of existing components.

services.txt: a list of the services available to components in the IPS and 
how to use them to be used as a reference while developing components.

simulations.txt: a guide on how to create simulations, including component 
composition, configuration, and building and running the IPS.

samples/ : this directory contains sample files for users to copy and 
augment to create components and simulations.
