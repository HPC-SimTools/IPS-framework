Document describing the SWIM framework, goals, usage, and innards.
This was written in Latex so that multiple people could hack at it simultaneously
and we could version control it - I still have not found a good MS Word
document version control system.

The main document is fmwk.tex, which mainly inputs the sections. 

To create the PDF paper, "make" should work provided you have pdflatex and bibltex
on your platform.  We also use the acronym package (thanks to David Bernholdt)
and a package called listings, not included in this directory. listings does a
good job of typesetting code listings, including Fortran 95.

Because of the way latex works, this just runs things twice to get references
resolved. That does mean any errors or warning will be given twice.  If the
make fails, just keep typing "x" and returns until latex gives up and you
get back to the prompt.
